While hitting up the popular dining spot, Taylor looked effortlessly chic in a strapless crop top complete with a matching black skirt by Hill House Home. She had her golden tresses tied back in a low updo and accessorized her look with paired with AUPEN’s vegan leather NIRVANA hand bag in Noir. Meanwhile, Zoe, rocked a similar ensemble to her A-lister bestie, as she opted for a figure-hugging black maxi dress. The Magic Mike star looked dapper in a monochromatic sage green shirt and matching dress pants.

The 33-year-old and other A-listers are in town for Jack’s wedding set to take place on Aug. 19 in Long Beach Island, New Jersey. Taylor and Jack have been friends for over a decade, as Swifties know, and they first worked together on “Sweeter Than Fiction” in 2013. Since then, he has become very close to Taylor and even produced her fifth album, 1989. Other famous artists he has worked with include Lana Del Rey, Lorde, St. Vincent, Sia, FKA Twigs, Sara Bareilles, and more.
Jack and Margaret got engaged in May 2022, as PEOPLE reported at the time. He began dating the Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood star in 2021, three years after he called it quits with Girls star Lena Dunham. In Jul. 2021 Jack told NME about his admiration for Taylor. “I’ve seen her change the music industry first-hand,” he said at the time. “She’s amazing for being a champion, and making things better for the generations to come. She has a long history of rightly exposing some real darkness in the music industry. And I’m personally thankful for it, outside of our friendship and working relationship, just as an artist. She’s asked me some questions a lot of people are afraid to ask.”
