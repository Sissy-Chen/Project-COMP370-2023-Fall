While tennis is growing in many departments, there are still some areas where more development is required. Rennae Stubbs has talked about her stance on the sport many times and feels that sexism still prevails. She reasoned that her coaching assessment was given flying remarks, but she still hasn’t received a single call from any player. While aiming to tackle these issues, she still celebrated the win.

Coco Gauff created a milestone for tennis as the viewers for the women’s singles at the US Open finals surmounted the audience for the men’s US Open finals. Additionally, Beyonce had the highest-grossing tour of the summer, Taylor Swift is likely the most popular artist in the world, and Barbie is one of the highest-grossing movies of this year so far.
These achievements were lauded by Chelsea Handler during her segment on ‘The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon’. She further led her assessment by saying that the growth is a sign that women are dominating many fields now. Noticing her assessment, Rennae Stubbs was unable to contain her excitement as she wrote, “Yes ladies! Stand up! @CocoGauff @HuskerVB @Barbie @Beyonce @taylorswift13“.

Stubbs is another figure in the sport who aims to improve women’s status in tennis. As she is a coach, she is aiming to include more women coaches in the field of tennis.

The former coach of Serena Williams is another voice of women empowerment in the sport. She aims to get more players to receive guidance from women coaches but is frustrated by her own situation. She had a short stint with the Queen of the Court, after which many said her phone would be ringing constantly for players to take her on as their guide.

However, Stubbs has not received a single call. She provides coverage for the sport, but she has not been presented with any offers for coaching. Although women’s tennis is becoming more relevant globally, there is still more space for inclusion and growth. With constant voices speaking for the change, hopefully we will see it soon.
