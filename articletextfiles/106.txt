Taylor Swift's highly-anticipated album 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is set to debut later this month, and it’s sure to become another massive chart win when it arrives. This album serves as a slight reimagining of her pop blockbuster 1989, which first captured the world's attention back in 2014. With an impressive seven singles under its belt, 1989 is undoubtedly one of Swift's most beloved and commercial successful releases.
When it comes to measuring the success of individual songs from 1989, there are many ways to measure one track against another. One easy way to do so is by delving into the consumption patterns of Americans and seeing what they’ve bought and streamed the most.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the organization responsible for awarding gold and platinum certifications to songs and albums based on consumption in the U.S., provides valuable insight into which tracks have made the biggest impact.
Topping the list of Swift's 1989 hits, according to RIAA certifications, is the album's lead single, "Shake It Off." The infectious anthem stands as Swift's sole diamond-certified hit, an accolade achieved when a track or album surpasses 10 million equivalent units in the United States.
Following closely behind is the chart-topping sensation "Blank Space," which has earned an impressive eight-times platinum certification, signifying eight million equivalent units sold. Swift's "Bad Blood," another Hot 100 chart-topper, is not far from “Shake It Off,” as it boasts a six-times platinum certification after moving six million equivalent units.
Two other singles from 1989, "Wildest Dreams" and "Style," have also reached multi-platinum status. "Wildest Dreams" has shifted four million equivalent units, while "Style" is inching closer to matching that figure, currently comfortably resting at triple platinum status.
Turning to non-single tracks from the album, two songs have earned platinum honors from the RIAA: the album opener "Welcome to New York" and the enchanting "This Love," both of which have moved at least one million equivalent units. Sixth official single "Out of the Woods" is also a platinum hit for the singer—one of dozens from her discography.
Four additional songs from 1989 have received gold certifications for surpassing the 500,000 equivalent unit mark. These include "All You Had to Do Was Stay," "How You Get the Girl," "I Know Places" and "New Romantics."
Interestingly, four songs from the album, including those featured on the deluxe edition, have yet to secure any certification from the RIAA. "I Wish You Would," "Clean," "Wonderland" and "You Are In Love" are all patiently awaiting recognition from the organization, though their eventual awards are likely on the horizon.
Update: This article originally stated that “Out of the Woods” had not yet received any certification from the RIAA. It was certified gold and then later, platinum.
