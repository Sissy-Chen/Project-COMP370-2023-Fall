TITLE: Swifties react to Taylor Swift’s surprise songs for Night One of the Eras Tour in Los Angeles

DESCRIPTION:
Taylor Swift surprised fans with acoustic performances of "I Can See You" and "Maroon" during night one of the Eras Tour in Los Angeles.

CONTENT:
Every night of the Eras Tour Swifties come together on social media for one common purpose, to mourn the loss of which surprise songs Taylor Swift played that night.
While Swift has a packed setlist for the Eras Tour, unfortunately, she cannot play her entire catalog in one night. To make up for this she has opted to surprise fans with acoustic versions of two of her songs that are not on the setlist each evening, playing one on guitar and the other on piano.

Swift had previously debuted the music video for fans during her tour on July 7 show in Kansas City. She also brought out the stars of the video, Joey King and Presley Cash who had both starred in the “Mean” music video, as well as Taylor Lautner who did a flip as he joined Swift on stage in Missouri.

In addition to playing “I Can See You” on guitar, Swift also performed “Maroon” from her latest album “Midnights” on the piano.
She had previously played “Maroon” as a surprise song during her first MetLife Stadium show in East Rutherford, New Jersey on May 26. She had told fans during the early days of the Eras Tour that while she doesn’t plan to repeat her surprise song choices, she would make an exception if she messed up during the surprise song.

Fans of the “Maroon” took to Twitter to process “losing” it as a surprise song option for the second time.
