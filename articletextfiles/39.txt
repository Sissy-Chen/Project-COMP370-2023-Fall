Taylor Swift is once again making headlines for her exceptional generosity. As she dazzles audiences with her mesmerizing performances on The Eras Tour, Swift has gone above and beyond to express her gratitude to the dedicated individuals working tirelessly behind the scenes.
People reports that the musical sensation has showered her entire touring company with an bonuses totaling an astonishing $55 million.
In an industry where teamwork is paramount, Swift has taken it upon herself to ensure that every member of her crew feels valued and appreciated. The initial report states that Swift's benevolence has extended to every corner of her touring ensemble. From backup dancers to caterers and audio technicians, it seems the singer was good to everyone working on the shows.
While the precise breakdown of individual bonuses remains undisclosed, a separate report from TMZ separately reported that the truckers responsible for transporting the elaborate equipment necessary for the shows to go off without a hitch reportedly received a staggering $100,000 each.
The Eras Tour kicked off in the spring, and it is well on its way to becoming a historic phenomenon. She has shows running in America through August, and then in November she heads to Central America for a few concerts. The venture picks back up again in 2024, and she has dates scheduled into next August.
Swift is making great money from The Eras Tour, and sheâ€™s still just getting started. By the time the run of concerts is through, it will likely become the highest-grossing trek of all time. It will also likely be the first to gross $1 billion in ticket sales.
With a net worth of $740 million, according to Forbes, Swift has the cash to be this generous, especially with tons flowing into her bank account thanks to her tour. In 2013, the magazine estimated that she earned $55 million, making her one of the highest-earning women and musicians in the world that year.
