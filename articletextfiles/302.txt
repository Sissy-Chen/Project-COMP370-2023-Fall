Taylor Swift's music is timeless...or is that timely? The singer currently has several hit singles dominating charts and captivating audiences worldwide. As "Karma," "Cruel Summer," and "Anti-Hero" maintain their strong presence among the top performers in the U.S., an unexpected yet delightful surprise has arrived: the reemergence of Swift's track "August." This resurgence could potentially propel the song back onto various Billboard charts, breathing new life into what is becoming another classic for her.
"August" is swiftly ascending Spotify's daily chart of the most-streamed tracks across the globe, marking a noticeable comeback. The song's trajectory is nothing short of remarkable, skyrocketing from outside the top 40 on July 31 to the No. 4 position on August 1. This notable ascent is made possible by over 5.1 million streams within a single day–a remarkable feat for a track that has already amassed millions of plays over the years.
The synchronicity of the resurgence is evident, with the shift from July to August serving as the catalyst for the track's renewed popularity. Swift's dedicated fanbase worldwide clearly rushed to celebrate the arrival of the new month by indulging in "August."
Initially unveiled as part of Swift's surprise album Folklore, which was released in the midst of the global Covid-19 pandemic in July 2020, "August" was never officially launched as a single. Despite this, it found its way onto charts, hitting No. 23 on the Hot 100. The track also secured a spot in the top 10 of genre-specific Billboard charts, including the Hot Rock & Alternative Songs list, where it climbed as high as No. 5.
The newfound streaming success currently being enjoyed by "August" means the tune now has the potential to return to various charts in the days and weeks to come. The song's consistent stream count, which have brought it to an impressive ranking on both Spotify's global and U.S.-only charts, bodes well for its chances of making a real comeback.
