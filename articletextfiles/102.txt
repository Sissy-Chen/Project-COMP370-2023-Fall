In a thrilling finale to her the U.S. leg of her The Eras Tour, Taylor Swift gave her fans the long-awaited revelation they wanted. The pop icon chose last night to officially announce her next addition to the re-recording series: 1989 (Taylor’s Version).
Swift's announcement electrified the atmosphere at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, leaving fans ecstatic over the news that the album is slated for release on October 27. Immediately after saying so in front of thousands, Swift took to social media to further tantalize her followers and provide a sneak peek into what lies ahead.
In a carefully crafted Instagram post, Swift not only confirmed the impending release of 1989 (Taylor’s Version), but also shared a few key details about the project. Similar to her previous re-recorded albums, this upcoming release will feature a treasure trove of never-before-heard tracks. Swift's journey down memory lane has led her to unearth a collection of songs that were either written or recorded during the original album sessions but remained hidden from the world. These unreleased gems, affectionately dubbed "From The Vault" tracks, are among the most exciting facets of the re-recording process.
Swift's social media update provided a glimpse into the forthcoming album's unknown tunes. She revealed that 1989 (Taylor’s Version) will include five "From The Vault" songs, in addition to the beloved tracks from the original album. About these cuts, Swift said in the caption, "the 5 From The Vault tracks are so insane. I can’t believe they were ever left behind."
While details about these tracks remain sparse at the moment, their potential for chart success is high. The combination of Swift's artistry, the nostalgia still felt for 1989 and its many hits as well as the aura of anticipation surrounding these unreleased tunes sets the stage for yet another triumphant chapter in her career.
1989 was a monumental triumph in Swift's time in the spotlight, solidifying her status as a global superstar. The album's extraordinary commercial success had led to it earning a nine-times platinum certification, and soon it may become her second diamond-seller. The album's singles, however, were the true driving force behind its enduring impact.
The 1989 era saw Swift dominate the charts with three No. 1 singles on the Hot 100. It is one of only a handful of albums to send that many cuts to the summit, even to this day. Iconic tracks such as "Shake It Off," "Blank Space" and "Bad Blood" featuring Kendrick Lamar, reigned supreme for a time.
Swift's subsequent albums have yet to match this impressive feat, as none of them have produced more than one Hot 100 No. 1. Among her leaders, "Shake It Off" stands as Swift's crowning achievement and biggest hit yet, as it has been certified diamond with over 10 million equivalent units moved in the U.S. "Blank Space" also emerged as a standout hit, as it has been certified eight-times platinum, tying as her second-most-certified single.
The album's tracks have collectively amassed over 36 million equivalent units in the U.S. alone. Collaborating with super producers and renowned hitmakers such as Max Martin, Ryan Tedder, and Jack Antonoff, Swift meticulously crafted a masterpiece that seamlessly bridged her transition from country to the pop realm. This transformation culminated in numerous Grammy wins and solidified her status as a musical icon.
Each track on 1989 held the potential for standalone success as singles, and if she’d wanted to, she likely could have continued promoting the set for years. The original album did spin off half a dozen charting hits, and fans wanted more. Now, with the inclusion of the "From The Vault" tracks, the album's legacy is set to grow once more.
The consistency of sound and thematic resonance throughout 1989 suggest that it’s likely that these five “From The Vault” songs are in the same vein. They could sound and feel similar, which immediately sets them up for success. Imagine another “Shake It Off” or “Style”? They could follow the surprising chart ascent of current single “Cruel Summer” which is also another electro-pop favorite that came several years later, inspired by some of the wins on 1989.
Swift's own excitement, reflected in her Instagram post, serves as a poignant reminder that these unreleased possible smashes possess the power to become hits in their own right. Nothing Swift says in social captions is a coincidence, so if she’s hinting that they could be huge, the world needs to prepare for them.
