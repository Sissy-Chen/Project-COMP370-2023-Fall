The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the New York Jets 23-20 in a thrilling match on Sunday night. Hours after the match started, Dave Portnoy, CEO of Barstool Sports also known for sparking controversies, Tweeted Aaron Rodgers‘ blank face.
Dave Portnoy took it to Twitter to compare two of the opponent’s stands, mentioning the excitement during the match and facial expressions transitioning throughout the match. Since the Chiefs dominated the match, Aaron’s fans took his side and showed full support for him.
Dave being Dave, wittily tweeted Aaron Rodgers’ blank face calling it tough to decide whom to support between him and Taylor Swift. Rodgers and Swift were in full support of the Jets and the Chiefs respectively.

Swift’s unexpected appearance was a delightful surprise for her fans, as she came out to support Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Their connection had already piqued interest when they were spotted together at Arrowhead Stadium the previous week. Swift was in the company of a star-studded group, including Ryan Reynolds, Blake Lively, Hugh Jackman, Sophie Turner, and filmmaker Shawn Levy, all cheering from a suite, and even making a few appearances on the NBC broadcast.
Fans had a good time reacting to Dave Portnoy’s tweet, they backed the injured Quarterback and flocked to his support.
Justin Gaard, the producer for Dan Barreiro on the Bumper to Bumper program on KFAN, mourned Aaron’s absence on the field and said he could have outperformed the whole opponent team.
It’s too bad he’s not playing tonight because he really would be the perfect villain to the entire production https://t.co/mx1zvNEIfK

Rodgers said on the match day that he was happy to be back with his team and hoped to play again this season. He was also seen chatting with Chiefs Patrick Mahomes(QB) and Woody Johnson(Jets Owner) and he was also seen on the field before the game. He is suffering from a ruptured Achilles in his season debut four weeks ago, and it was his first attendance at the stadium since his injury. He also met with former Jets centre Nick Mangold and gave him a signed jersey.
