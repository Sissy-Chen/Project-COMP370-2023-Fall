Taylor Swift has maintained her very significant presence on Spotify ever since her music reappeared on the platform a few years ago. Now, the accomplished singer-songwriter has made history on the streaming giant, with even Spotify itself celebrating her latest achievement.
In a recent announcement on its social media platforms, Spotify proudly shared that Swift has officially become the first woman to amass an astounding 100 million monthly active listeners. This impressive feat means that over the course of the last month, a staggering 100 million distinct individuals from all parts of the globe have tuned in to enjoy at least one of the superstar's tracks.
While Swift may be the first woman to hit this remarkable milestone on the world's largest streaming platform, it's worth noting that, when considering all artists, she ranks second.
Earlier this year, The Weeknd secured the distinction of being the first musician to surpass the 100 million monthly listeners mark. In February, the Canadian pop and R&B sensation accomplished this groundbreaking feat, setting a new standard for streaming accomplishments. He now claims just under 110 million monthly listeners.
Numerous factors are currently contributing to Swift's exceptional performance on Spotify. The artist has always had a knack for attracting listeners, but August has proven to be particularly fruitful. Her most recent album, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), which was released just a month ago, continues to enjoy robust streams. Additionally, her track "Cruel Summer," from the 2019 album Lover, is currently among the platform's most-played songs.
Meanwhile, anticipation for the re-release of her earlier album 1989 this fall has sparked renewed interest in the original version as well. Some casual fans may be busy returning to that collection following her announcement that she’s re-recording it, as many of the songs featured on it have jumped in consumption.
All of these events are helping Swift’s performance on Spotify, but it’s important to note that what’s most impressive is the fact that her music is reaching a larger audience than ever. The 100 million number being reported doesn’t specifically focus on those playing one tune and moving on or super fans streaming everything she’s released—it’s simply about the number of people tuning in. Her reach is expanding, and that’s impressive, considering how popular she has been for so many years.
