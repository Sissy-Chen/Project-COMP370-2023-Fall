TITLE: SoFi Stadium’s Taylor Swift merch sale brings out the masses – a day before the shows even begin

DESCRIPTION:
From overnight camping to hours of waiting to quick sell-outs, Swifties rushed to social media to document the Eras Tour early merchandise day in Inglewood.

CONTENT:
If you go to one of Taylor Swift’s widely-anticipated, sold out shows and don’t return home with merchandise, did you even go?
If you get merchandise but couldn’t score tickets, isn’t it kind of like you went?
This seems to be the mentality of a lot of giddy fans, who lined up on Wednesday, Aug. 2, at SoFi Stadium – a day before the first of Swift’s six Inglewood concerts – for official Swiftie merchandise.
To ease the almost-guaranteed rush for T-shirts, posters, hoodies, postcards, guitar picks, and various other T. Swift mementos, Swift and SoFi announced that the day before the first show, a merchandise stand outside the stadium would be open.
Queue the masses.

The stand was officially open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., but – to no surprise – the Swifties came early.

And if you think that’s early, get this: Some superfans seemingly camped overnight to be first in line for the merchandise’s inaugural day in LA.

The turnout was huge and, paired with 80 degree temperatures, the line made it a Cruel Summer day for many: Fans reported waits from three to five hours.

Pretty quickly, rumors of sold out merchandise started to circulate. Take this one, tweeted only three and a half hours into the event:
If you’re coming to buy Taylor Swift merch at SoFi …don’t. They’re pretty much sold out of everything at 1:30 pm and there are still a couple thousand people in line

Or this, two hours and twenty minutes in:

The alleged wait had many onlookers perplexed.
Okay I get the Taylor swift eras tour hype it looks like all the girlies have so much fun but lining up outside of sofi at 3 am just for merch?! Insanity.

I don’t think I can recall seeing anything like what’s happening with the line for concert merch at SoFi Stadium for Taylor Swift.  Who else has had a 3 hour line for the merch stand of a concert, a day before the actual concert?

While many were out, some fans thought they’d have an easier time getting merch online, given the traffic, wait times and general craziness.
I live in walking distance and it’s bananas. The traffic around is already (more) insane… 🫣

Of course, those successful (or lucky enough to have a successful friend) took to the internet for bragging rights.

If you couldn’t make it, or got to the front of the line and were greeted by sold out signs, no worries.

On show days, the merchandise stands outside the stadium will open at noon each day, with additional merchandise booths inside the stadium as well (where some have found better luck).
BUY YOUR MERCH INSIDE THE STADIUM ‼️ Save yourself time and get everything you want by getting in line for the stadium gates early and going straight to the merch on your level. Good luck!! #taylorswifterastour #erastour #taylorswift #erastourmerch #erastourcrewneck #tstheerastour #merch
