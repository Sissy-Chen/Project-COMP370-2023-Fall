Taylor Swift holds the top of the Billboard 200 album chart with her latest remake, while Jung Kook of BTS opens at No. 2 and a posthumous release by Jimmy Buffett lands in the Top 10.
“1989 (Taylor’s Version),” a rerecording of Swift’s nine-year-old LP, stays at No. 1 for a second time after a huge debut, when the new edition topped the opening-week sales of the original. In its second week out, the remade “1989” had the equivalent of 245,000 sales in the United States, including 160 million streams and 122,000 copies sold as a complete package, according to data from the tracking service Luminate.
Jung Kook, the latest member of the K-pop kings BTS to release a solo album during the group’s hiatus, starts at No. 2 with “Golden,” which notched nearly 42 million streams and sold 128,500 copies as a complete album, mostly on CD. Jung Kook — whose name is also sometimes spelled Jungkook — had a No. 1 single this summer with “Seven,” featuring the rapper Latto.
Buffett, the “Margaritaville” singer who died of skin cancer in September at age 76, opens at No. 6 with “Equal Strain on All Parts,” which Buffett recorded this year and completed before his death. Featuring guest spots by Emmylou Harris, Angélique Kidjo and others — Paul McCartney plays bass on one song — “Equal Strain” arrived with 51,000 sales.
Also this week, Drake’s “For All the Dogs” is No. 3, Morgan Wallen’s “One Thing at a Time” is No. 4 and Bad Bunny’s “Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana” is No. 5.
