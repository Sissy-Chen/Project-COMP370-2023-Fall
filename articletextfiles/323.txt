Taylor Swift is currently juggling various projects and accomplishments while simultaneously looking towards the future. Amidst her ongoing The Eras Tour, the sales of her latest album, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), are thriving, and her single "Cruel Summer" is looking to claim the top spot on the Hot 100 chart. Despite these impressive feats, one of Swift's most prominent singles is staging a remarkable resurgence.
"Blank Space," a signature hit from Swift, is making an unexpected and intriguing comeback, gaining momentum gradually yet consistently. The song is undergoing a resurgence in popularity that has taken many by surprise, leaving the potential for its growth virtually limitless.
Last week, "Blank Space" reappeared on the Hot 100 chart at No. 49. Billboard's regulations usually prevent tracks that have spent a certain number of weeks on the chart from making a return unless they regain enough popularity to secure a place within the top half. Consequently, when a song is eventually removed from the list or naturally falls off, it typically remains absent from then on.
"Blank Space" defied these odds, and it didn’t stop there.
Remarkably, within just one week after its reappearance, "Blank Space" has climbed a few notches to reach No. 46 on the current Hot 100. All indications suggest that this upward trend could persist in the forthcoming weeks, allowing the song to continue its ascent.
The resurgence of “Blank Space” can be attributed to Swift’s announcement that her next re-recorded album will be the iconic 1989. This pop blockbuster propelled "Blank Space" to the forefront as its second single, eventually hitting No. 1 on the Hot 100.
Swift's dedicated fans swiftly flocked to the original album following the mid-concert announcement of 1989 (Taylor’s Version), catapulting it back into the top 10 of the Billboard 200 ranking. Evidently, among all the tracks on the title, "Blank Space" has gained the favor of the masses. With a surge in streams and purchases of the song, coupled with what must be at least a noticeable number of radio programmers reintroducing it into their rotations, "Blank Space" has exceeded expectations, securing a place on the Hot 100 one again.
"Blank Space" has already achieved the remarkable milestone of being certified eight times platinum, reflecting the fact that it has moved eight million equivalent copies in the United States alone. Given its current trajectory, it's entirely plausible that "Blank Space" could achieve diamond status by reaching the 10 million equivalent units mark in the coming months.
