Week after week, Taylor Swift continues to achieve feats on the Billboard charts that are nothing short of remarkable. Her accomplishments often rival the most significant milestones in any other artist's career. The current week is no exception, as her performance on a specific Billboard ranking underscores not only her influence and popularity but also her ability to manage multiple successful projects simultaneously.
Presently, Swift occupies eight spots on Billboard's Canadian Hot 100, the weekly compilation of the most-consumed songs in Canada. While this is an impressive achievement, it's not her number of charting tracks that's particularly striking. Instead, it's the range of albums these songs hail from that truly stands out.
Among the eight tracks Swift currently has charting on the Canadian Hot 100, they originate from five distinct albums. Few artists can manage the feat of sending multiple tracks from more than one of their own albums to a competitive ranking of hits at one time. Achieving such a showing with five albums at once is virtually unheard of, and Swift might be one of the few—if not the first—to accomplish such a remarkable feat.
At the forefront of Swift's current successes on the Canadian Hot 100 is "Cruel Summer." This latest hit from the singer reaches a new peak of No. 2, and it is potentially poised to claim the chart's top spot, if it can surpass Morgan Wallen's formidable single "Last Night." "Cruel Summer," featured on her 2019 pop album Lover, was recently released as an official single after enjoying newfound popularity among fans.
Returning to the top 10 is "Karma," the most recent single from her latest entirely original release, Midnights. The song rises once again to No. 10, having previously reached No. 4. Not far behind, another track from Midnights, "Anti-Hero," remains popular at No. 20.
In an unexpected move, the next two charting singles from Swift are both from her 2014 blockbuster album 1989. "Style" and "Blank Space" make modest ascents, reaching Nos. 34 and 36, respectively. These tracks, which remain among her top-performing songs ever, have experienced renewed interest following Swift's announcement of the re-recorded version of 1989 is set for release this fall.
Just a couple of positions below "Blank Space," there's "August." Though not formally released as a single, the track has garnered substantial fan appreciation. Originally part of her surprise album Folklore, released amid the global pandemic in 2020, it has resurfaced on several Billboard charts, appropriately coinciding with the change from July to August.
Swift's final two placements on the Canadian Hot 100 stem from her most recent project, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version). This re-recorded and re-released edition of her early work proved to be a massive global success upon its release a month ago. This week, "I Can See You (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)" rises to No. 63, after previously reaching as high as No. 8. Occupying the No. 76 spot is "Enchanted (Taylor’s Version)," a favorite re-recording among Canadian fans.
