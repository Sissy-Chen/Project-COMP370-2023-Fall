Taylor Swift is the queen of surprise drops and hidden messages, so any time there’s the remotest of chances that something attached to the superstar might be foreshadowing what’s to come, her fans jump at it and set the internet abuzz with speculation. It has only been a few weeks since the release of her latest re-recorded album, but Swifties have already clocked what might be a hint about her next project. This time, the tantalizing clue didn't come directly from the singer herself but from an unexpected source.
As Swift's massively successful The Eras Tour continues, with her next stop being in Los Angeles, fans noticed something intriguing in a tweet from the SoFi Stadium, where she is set to headline for six nights. Shortly before she’s set to begin her residency (of sorts), the venue tweeted, "Only 3 more days until @taylorswift13. We are so excited to welcome her to Los Angeles: (Taylor's Version)."
While the message might seem simple at first glance, it's the accompanying images that have Swifties in a frenzy. The tweet included four pictures, and one of them caught the attention of eagle-eyed fans. It featured a lifeguard shack on the beach, with the numbers "1989" written on the wood, along with the text "(Taylor's Version)" below it—all edited to ensure the words were clear to see.
The significance of this image lies in the fact that 1989 is the title of one of Swift's most iconic albums, originally released in 2014. With the text "(Taylor's Version)" clearly indicated, it strongly suggests that 1989 might be the next album Swift chooses to re-record and re-release.
But that's not all. Another image in the tweet depicted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, except instead of someone's name, it read "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)." "Wildest Dreams" is one of Swift's well-known singles, and one of the top 10 hits from 1989. The fact that a re-recorded version of it could potentially appear on the as-yet-unannounced 1989 (Taylor's Version) adds even more weight to the speculation. Swift actually already released "Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)" a while back as a one-off treat for fans, but the fact that it’s being mentioned again wasn’t missed by her followers.
So far, Swift has already re-recorded and re-released three of her first six albums – Fearless (Taylor's Version), Red (Taylor's Version), and Speak Now (Taylor's Version). Each of these albums has achieved considerable success, hitting No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart and spawning numerous Hot 100 hits.
This re-recording project was born out of Swift's desire to reclaim ownership of her music after the rights to her original recordings were sold away from her. Taking matters into her own hands, she aims to regain control and preserve her artistic legacy...and score some major chart wins in the process.
As for the exact timeline for 1989 (Taylor's Version) or any other potential re-recordings, no official announcements have been made. It is evident that Swift is hard at work, not only on her new projects but also on these re-recordings. A hint like this one could possibly mean something, but when it comes to Swift, who loves a good Easter Egg, chances are it is exactly what many fans assume it means.
