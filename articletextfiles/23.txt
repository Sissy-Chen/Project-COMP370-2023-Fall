Earlier this month, Taylor Swift delighted her fans by announcing her plans to re-record and re-release her next album, the iconic 1989. This exciting revelation was made during the final U.S. stop on the current leg of her The Eras Tour.
Ever since this announcement and the confirmation that the album will drop on October 27, fans have been diving back into the original tracks, streaming them with renewed enthusiasm. Now, one particular song from the album is surging on a significant Billboard chart, reaffirming that fans's love for it remains as strong as it was when it was first introduced.
This week, Swift's single "Style" climbs the ranks on the Streaming Songs chart—a weekly compilation of the most-streamed tracks in the United States. The infectious tune soars from its previous position at No. 50, where it sat last time around, to No. 40, making a notable leap of 10 spots in one go. This newfound prominence marks the song's highest standing in quite some time and indicates a promising future ahead for the beloved track.
"Style" isn't Swift’s sole representation on the Streaming Songs chart. In fact, she has several of her compositions from various albums gracing the competitive ranking. "Style" itself follows behind "Cruel Summer," which holds at its peak position of No. 5, along with "Anti-Hero" at No. 23 and "Karma" at No. 38. Astonishingly, "Style" is not even the only tune from 1989 on the chart either. "Blank Space" also makes its presence felt at No. 41, and is also steadily gaining traction.
Since the announcement of Swift's re-recorded version of 1989, the songs from the album have witnessed a huge surge in consumption. This phenomenon has translated into immediate gains on the Spotify charts, with many tracks from the Grammy-winning album experiencing a rejuvenated gain in streaming popularity. Clearly, both "Style" and "Blank Space" have resonated as favorites among the fans, and this momentum might continue to build in the forthcoming weeks.
"Style" was selected as the third official single from Swift's original 1989 album. The song was heavily promoted in early 2015 and eventually peaked at No. 6 on the Hot 100 chart. Now, with its current resurgence, it's poised to potentially reach new heights, at least on the Streaming Songs tally, where it has thus far peaked just a few spaces above where it sits now.
If this upward trajectory continues, it might even reappear on the Hot 100 chart, much like "Blank Space" has managed to do in the recent weeks.
