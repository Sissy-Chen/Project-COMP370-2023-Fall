TITLE: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce timeline: Every moment in whirlwind 'dating' saga, from concert to convertible

DESCRIPTION:
Explaining the Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce relationship timeline. From friendship bracelets to stadium suites and every moment in between of their whirlwind relationship.

CONTENT:
In case you've somehow missed it, there's a new power couple in town. Kelce and Swift have taken over the world, and this time, we're not talking about the Eagles players.
Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, eight-time NFL Pro Bowler and 12-time Grammy Award winner -- they are the best of the best in their respective careers.
Her Eras Tour took the world by storm this summer, and it's only just begun. The final U.S. leg kicks off in a few weeks before she heads across the globe.
Kelce spent his summer preparing for the NFL season after another Super Bowl win ... and attending said Eras Tour, apparently.
Even though Swift might be a little upset about Kansas City's Super Bowl victory, a title the Chiefs won by defeating her hometown Eagles, she's decided to give Kelce a chance in the midst of their busy lives. They've found plenty of time to connect after months of Kelce's publicly declaring "you belong with me."
It seems to be an all-time love story in the making.

Here's what you need to know about their relationship, from friendship bracelets to convertibles. 
July 8: Arrowhead Stadium is where it all started. Swift made a tour stop Kansas City, and the Chiefs tight end made sure to attend her three-hour long show.
July 26: Kelce took to his and brother Jason's podcast, New Heights, to say he tried to meet the singer before the concert. He made a bracelet, a Swiftie tradition from her song "You're On Your Own Kid," with his phone number and wanted to give it to her before she went on stage at Arrowhead Stadium.
“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings, so I was a little butt-hurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” Kelce admitted.
September 12: After a quiet few months, rumors begin again once it's reported that Swift and Kelce were "quietly hanging out."
September 20: Jason Kelce joined 94 WIP Sports Radio in Philadelphia and was, without surprise, asked about his brother's romantic life. He confirmed the rumors.
September 21: Just a day later, Kelce aimed for Swift again. He joined the Pat McAfee Show and asked the singer to come watch him "rock the stage at Arrowhead" just as she had done months prior.
We GOTTA ask about you and Taylor Swift.."I told her that I've seen her rock a stage in Arrowhead and she might have to come see me rock the stage at Arrowhead..We'll see what happens in the near future"🗣🗣LET’S GOOOOO @tkelce #PMSLive pic.twitter.com/dYEyxvYfLw
September 24: And there she was, leaving her Eagles t-shirt hanging on the door for the gold rush of the Chiefs Kingdom. She cheered Kelce on from the suites with his mother, Donna, as the Chiefs took care of the Bears. Kelce scored one touchdown in the 41-10 victory.

After the game, the two were seen leaving together, with the tight end wearing a suit later renamed to the "1989 Bedroom Painting Set" for her album that's being rereleased in October. Swift got in in Kelce's getaway car, and they headed to dinner at a rented-out restaurant.

September 26: Like always, the couple has some fans, while others think the relationship is full of bad blood. Maya Benberry, Kelce's ex, warned Swift that he's trouble in an exclusive with Daily Mail. She said he cheated during their eight-month relationship, but Kelce denies the claims.
“Taylor seems like such a fun girl with a beautiful spirit, so I wish her the best of luck, but I wouldn’t be a girls’ girl if I didn’t advise her to be smart!" Benberry said. "Only time will tell but like the saying always goes, once a cheater, always a cheater.”
September 27: Kelce and Swift seemed to shake off Benberry's comments in time for another episode of New Heights. The brothers discussed the new romantics after Sunday's events, to which Kelce said he had the best day with her watching him on the field. He added he won't be discussing their relationship on any future shows or interviews.

That evening, a photo was leaked by TMZ of the couple from the game's after-party. Swift was seen with her arm around Kelce at the restaurant they rented out. The couple will have all eyes on them again this weekend when MetLife Stadium says "Welcome to New York" (well, New Jersey). She'll be attendance for the Chiefs game against the Jets.

September 28: Mavericks coach Mark Cuban hopped on First Take and asked Swift to break up with Kelce.
"Taylor, sorry if you're listening Travis. Break up with him, I got a bunch of good-looking single guys that play for the Dallas Mavericks," Cuban joked.
Don't worry, that won't be happening, because suddenly Kelce plays basketball in Dallas.
