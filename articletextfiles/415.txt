In just a matter of weeks, Taylor Swift is poised to unleash her highly-anticipated re-release of the album 1989, now titled 1989 (Taylor’s Version). The revamped version of 1989 will feature slight reworkings of the original tracks from an album that not only achieved massive sales as a collection but also spawned seven hit singles.
Among its popular singles, which include chart-toppers like "Blank Space," "Bad Blood," and "Shake It Off," there exists an intriguing oddity: one of the official singles from the project has never been certified by the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America).
The RIAA is responsible for bestowing prestigious certifications such as gold, platinum, or diamond plaques upon tracks and albums that meet specific sales thresholds. Gold is awarded for 500,000 equivalent units sold, platinum for one million, and diamond for 10 million.
Almost every song featured on 1989 has earned some form of certification, which is a common occurrence for some the most successful albums of recent years. However, what’s shocking is that one of the official singles from the album has yet to receive any recognition from the RIAA.
"Out of the Woods" was chosen as the sixth official single from 1989. Released in January 2016, well over a year and a half after Swift started promoting the album, it arrived as one of the final offerings from the project. Surprisingly, despite the album being out in the world for more than a year by the time the tune was promoted, the track still performed well.
Swift propelled "Out of the Woods" into the top 20 on the Hot 100, and it peaked at No. 18. The single also enjoyed success on the radio, landing within the top 20 on all three of Billboard's pop-focused radio charts. Still, despite industry acclaim and evident public interest, the single has yet to achieve even a gold certification.
To put this anomaly into perspective, several non-single tracks from 1989 that never received the official single treatment have garnered at least one RIAA award. "This Love" achieved platinum certification, while album cuts like "All You Had to Do Was Stay" and "How You Get the Girl" have been certified gold.
It is probable that "Out of the Woods" has accumulated significant sales and streams deserving of recognition, and it may be a matter of Swift's label or the RIAA taking the time to process the necessary paperwork and confirm the consumption numbers for award presentation. While it remains uncertain when and at what level the certification will be bestowed, it is likely that Swift's single will ultimately join its fellow 1989 tracks in receiving the recognition it deserves—perhaps soon.
