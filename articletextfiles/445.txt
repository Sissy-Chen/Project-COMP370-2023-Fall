Swift wears the hat while she performs “22” in a similar outfit to what she wore during the music video for the “Red” single. Its become a tradition at concerts for one member of the audience to receive the hat from Taylor during the performance.
While often times its a fan picked at random from the stadium, sometimes Taylor picks someone special in advance. For instance when Selena Gomez watched the Arlington, Texas stop, Swift had Gomez’s sister Gracie Teefey receive the hat.

Another memorial recipient of the 22 hat was Mikael Arellano, a fan beloved by Swifties in the TikTok space who created the viral “Bejewled” dance trend.

Bianka Bryant receiving the 22 hat is the latest act of kindness that Swift has given to the Bryant daughters. In 2020 Swift sent Natalia Bryant a “folklore” cardigan. Natalia shared the cardigan on her Instagram story, adding that she was “obsessed” with the album.
Bianka receiving the hat was a special moment for fans of both Swift and Kobe. The late basketball star had previously joined the popstar on stage during her 1989 tour. “Make some noise for your own Kobe Bryant” said Swift after Bryant made his way to her as she performed “Style.” Bryant went on to cut the song short so he could present Swift with a banner during her 1989 tour for the most sold out performances at the then Staples Center.
