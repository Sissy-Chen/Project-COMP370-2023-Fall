Taylor Swift continues to control the Billboard 200 this week with her latest release, 1989 (Taylor’s Version). The set debuted atop the ranking of the most-consumed albums in the U.S. last time around with more than 1.6 million equivalent units shifted—the largest start of her career. Now, it’s a non-mover at No. 1 with more than 200,000 more units moved.
As fans continue to buy and stream 1989 (Taylor’s Version) in huge enough numbers to keep it at No. 1 in America, it’s not as if her older albums are done with. In fact, one of her early re-recordings is still going strong, and this frame it reaches a special milestone.
Red (Taylor’s Version) has now lived on the Billboard 200 for 104 weeks, or exactly two years. This frame, the title slips slightly, dipping from No. 23 to No. 25.
According to data shared by Luminate, Red (Taylor’s Version) moved another 25,000 equivalent units this week. That sum includes 6,500 pure purchases—a very strong number for a title that’s been out in the world for at least two years.
Red (Taylor’s Version) served as the second re-recording Swift released in her effort to rework her first six albums as a way to regain control over the masters in a clever manner. The set opened at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in November 2021 with 605,000 equivalent units moved. It marked her tenth trip to the summit at the time, but since then, she’s scored several more winners.
The title is one of Swift’s 10 that is currently present on the Billboard 200. Amazingly, even though it’s still sitting as high as No. 25 on the chart, it’s only her seventh-highest-ranking of the bunch. Red (Taylor’s Version) is the singer’s eleventh title to spend at least two years on the Billboard 200, with many holding on for much, much longer.
