As Travis Scott rules the Billboard 200 for a third week with his new blockbuster album Utopia, Taylor Swift makes history on the chart yet again. The singer occupies four spots inside the top 10 on the tally, which is a feat rarely seen. The pop icon has owned that many spaces inside the region for some time now, but this week is different.
Swift’s 1989 album surges on the Billboard 200, returning to the top 10 once again. The pop project rises noticeably thanks to the announcement that the set is going to be re-recorded and re-released. During the last stop on her The Eras Tour in America (for now, at least), the singer told the audience, and thus the world, that 1989 (Taylor’s Version) is coming soon. The re-worked version of the Grammy-winning title is expected in late October.
As her die-hard followers prepare for 1989 (Taylor’s Version), they are busy listening to the original. The songs on 1989 have jumped in consumption ever since her show-stopping (literally) announcement. Many of them have rocketed up the Spotify charts, and now all that listening has helped the title perform well once again.
The set returns to the top 10 on the Billboard 200 once again, finding space inside the area for the first time in years. 1989 hasn’t been seen in the highest tier on the all-encompassing ranking of the most-consumed albums in America since early 2016, according to Billboard. This week, the title shifted another 45,000 equivalent units.
Surprisingly, despite the fact that the album has been out for eight years, it didn’t have far to climb. Last week, 1989 sat at No. 13 on the Billboard 200. Now, it’s up to No. 9, lifting four very important spaces.
Swift almost made history in another way, as she nearly claimed half of the top 10 on the Billboard 200. The singer’s other album Folklore falls out of the highest tier as 1989 advances. That title, which was another No. 1 in 2020, dips from No. 9 to No. 11. It’s also beaten by fellow Swift releases Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) at No. 5, Midnights at No. 6, and Lover at No. 7.
