Jessie James Decker told Fox News Digital what advice she would give to Taylor Swift when it comes to dating an athlete, saying "it's a different world."
Jessie James Decker knows a thing or two about being romantically involved with a professional athlete, and she's prepared to share her wisdom with Taylor Swift.
Speaking to Fox News Digital at the People's Choice Country Awards, Decker revealed what she'd tell Swift about dating an NFL player as the pop star continues to make headlines for her rumored romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.
"I think there's no advice," Decker admitted with a smile as husband Eric Decker, a former pro football player, stood behind her. "I think I would just tell her, like, ‘Have fun,’ because you know what, she's never dated an athlete or a football player to my knowledge, and it is a different world.

TAYLOR SWIFT-TRAVIS KELCE DATING RUMORS: WHY CELEBRITY-NFL ROMANCES ‘NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE’
This year has been an eventful year for Swift. Her massively successful Eras Tour aside, she also broke up with longtime boyfriend Joe Alwyn. Following their split, she was briefly linked to singer Matt Healy, but rumors began earlier this month that she'd been getting friendly with Kelce.

After reports began circulating, Kelce's brother Jason said that while he wasn't sure, he believed the dating rumors were "100% true." Travis Kelce later spoke out about Swift, saying he "threw the ball in her court" while still not outright confirming the relationship.
Last weekend, Swift was photographed at a Chiefs game, hanging out in a suite at Arrowhead Stadium with Kelce's mother wearing red and white, the Chiefs colors. They were also spotted together after the game.
