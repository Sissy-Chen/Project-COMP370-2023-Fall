Taylor Swift fans in Canada can finally breathe easy.
The U.S. singer-songwriter announced six new shows in Toronto next year as part of her Eras Tour.
Swift will perform at the Rogers Centre from Nov. 14 to 16, 2024 and then Nov. 21 to 23, 2024.
“Turns out it’s NOT the end of an era,” Swift wrote on her Twitter account Thursday.
“Miami, New Orleans, Indy and Toronto: The Eras Tour is coming to you in 2024 with @gracieabrams.”

Tickets are not on sale right now, but fans can register online on Ticketmaster’s website to help get seats for all six shows.
Due to the heavy traffic, there was a line to even register as a verified fan Thursday.
The announcement comes after Swift left Canada out of 14 new tour dates released last month, disappointing Canadians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Trudeau replied to her July announcement with a message on Twitter referencing a few of Swift’s songs, including Cruel Summer.
“It’s me, hi. I know places in Canada would love to have you. So, don’t make it another cruel summer. We hope to see you soon.”
Swift’s perceived snub even reached the House of Commons, with a Conservative MP saying he would file an “official grievance within Parliament on behalf of all Swifties” in the country.
Swift last performed in Canada in 2018.
The Eras Tour, which began in the United States in March, will see Swift perform across the globe.
The U.S. leg has already seen sell-out shows with fans triggering a 2.3-magnitude earthquake in Seattle last month.
It cannot be said for certain whether the seismic activity was caused by soundwaves generated from bass, subwoofers, jumping fans or a combination of factors.

Swift’s decision to only perform in Toronto makes her the first artist to do six nights at the Rogers Centre stadium as part of a single tour.
Canada’s huge landmass and its relatively smaller population makes it a “really tough country to tour,” Eric Alper, a music industry expert in Toronto, previously told Global News.
Compared to the U.S. and the U.K., Canada also does not have many large venues that can hold over 50,000 people, Alper said.
The Rogers Centre, home of Toronto’s Blue Jays, is undergoing a massive $300 million renovation. The first phase of the changes, unveiled in April, have reduced the stadium’s seating capacity by seven percent to 41,500, according to media reports. However, that number does not take into account floor seats or standing room capacity.
Mega tours do have economic impacts on the cities they visit, Concordia University economist Moshe Lander told Global News in June.
“With a Taylor Swift concert, the economic benefit would be in the tourist dollars that it brings in,” he said.
Swift, a multiple Grammy winner, is also slated to take the stage in Mexico, Europe, Asia and Australia over the next year.
Canadians have shown they are willing to travel to see Swift and other attractions. The border crossings in British Columbia were extremely busy last month ahead of her concerts in Seattle, which also coincided with a Blue Jays-Mariners series.
The Eras Tour is now set to end in Toronto on Nov. 23, 2024 – unless more shows are added.
