In early November, Taylor Swift will collect another No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 with her about-to-be-released set 1989 (Taylor's Version). The re-recorded take on her first pure pop collection is all but guaranteed to reach the top spot, and when it does, it will mark the third time the set of songs breaks into the highest tier on the all-encompassing ranking of the most-consumed full-lengths in the U.S.
1989 was first introduced to the Billboard 200 back in late 2014. Swift topped the tally once again with the blockbuster release, which wasted no time going right to No. 1. 1989 opened atop the ranking with 1.287 million copies sold.
In the years since 1989 debuted at No. 1, the set has continued to perform well on the Billboard 200. In fact, it has even returned to the top 10 recently, after interest in the title surged following Swift's announcement that it was to be the next to be re-recorded and re-released.
A year after Swift dominated the Billboard 200 with 1989, singer-songwriter Ryan Adams put his own spin on the set. The rocker recorded a complete covers album, not mixing up much from the original. Adams's version of 1989 debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 in the fall of 2015. Impressively, it launched just one spot ahead of Swift's edition, which was still going strong inside the top 10 at the time.
Now, Swift is about to return to the highest region on the Billboard 200 with 1989 (Taylor's Version). There's no telling exactly how big the title will be when it arrives, but so far, all three of the re-recordings that Swift has released have gone straight to the summit, and they keep getting bigger and bigger. 1989 (Taylor's Version) could possibly open with a million equivalent units, or perhaps just under that, making it not only the largest entrance sum for one of her re-records but one of the biggest in recent memory.
