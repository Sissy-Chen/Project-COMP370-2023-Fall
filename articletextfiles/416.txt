While Taylor Swift is currently engrossed in the promotion of her single "Cruel Summer" from her 2019 album Lover, she might already have her sights set on her next move. "Cruel Summer" gained unexpected popularity earlier this year and has now found its way into the top 10 of the Hot 100 chart, with a chance to rise even further in the coming weeks. Amidst her focus on the catchy pop track, she might be secretly contemplating her next musical move.
Whether Swift intends to release more singles from her latest album of original material, Midnights, remains unknown. Considering the series of events that have unfolded since the album's late 2022 release, she might be ready to move on, or she might be trying to choose what comes next. One track in particular seems to be the frontrunner for single status, and it's a very good choice.
Hints have been circulating that "Bejeweled" is in the running to be chosen as the fourth official single from Midnights, although Swift hasn't officially confirmed this speculation. If this turns out to be true, it would indeed be a strategic choice.
To begin with..."Bejeweled" is already a hit in its own right. During the week of the Midnight’s release, Swift dominated the entire top 10 of the Hot 100, with 10 tracks from the album taking up space in the competitive region. "Bejeweled" reached as high as No. 6 on the chart, so it doesn’t have much higher to go if it is promoted.
The song even received its own music video, but that doesn't mean it's been given the full might of a Swift single. It has thus far been held back to promotional single status, and there's more that could be done with the tune.
As Swift continues her The Eras Tour, she has been captivating massive crowds with performances of the songs from Midnights. The U.S. leg has concluded, and the tour is currently making its mark in Central America. With "Bejeweled" making its appearance on the tour's setlist each evening, Swift has the opportunity to remind tens of thousands of fans every night of the song's appeal. This attention could translate into increased streaming numbers and purchases if Swift officially announces "Bejeweled" as her next single.
Speculations around "Bejeweled" being promoted as a single gained momentum just before Swift embarked on her six-night "residency" at Los Angeles's SoFi Stadium. The venue's official Twitter account shared altered images that hinted at several special things in her future.
Notably, one teaser alluded to Swift's announcement of her upcoming re-recorded album, 1989 (Taylor's Version). With this prediction turning out to be very true, the image in the same tweet referring to "Bejeweled" cannot be overlooked.
As Swift balances her tour efforts and pursues the No. 1 spot for "Cruel Summer" on the Hot 100, she is simultaneously working on another project. 1989 (Taylor's Version) is anticipated to drop in late October, and how she’ll approach promoting the set remains a mystery. It could potentially become her most successful re-release yet, generating a multitude of hit singles.
In this context, the potential selection of "Bejeweled" as a single from Midnights could either complement or influence these upcoming plans. If Swift does decide to shift her focus back to Midnights, "Bejeweled" might prove to be an excellent choice for a successful single release, but at this point, there’s no telling what she plans on doing.
Note: This article has been updated to include language clarifying that "Bejeweled" has already been released as a promotional single, but not a full-fledged single.
