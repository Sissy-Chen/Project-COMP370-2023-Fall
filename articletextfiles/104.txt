Taylor Swift is the queen of the Billboard charts this week–a title she’s accustomed to these days. The singer sits at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 albums chart and the Hot 100 songs ranking as her new set 1989 (Taylor’s Version) dominates. While her latest album is a blockbuster as it arrives, it’s on the Hot 100 where her name appears almost everywhere.
Swift claims 22 spaces on the Hot 100 this week. Amazingly, all but two of those hits appear inside the top 40 on the tally–the region that typically dictates when a charting track becomes a hit. The singer actually claims half of all the available real estate inside the area this time around.
Included in that string of 20 top 40 Hot 100 hits are eight top 10s. Leading the charge is her single "Is It Over Now?" That track debuts at No. 1, giving Swift her eleventh leader on the most important songs ranking in America.
Before this week, Swift had charted 119 top 40 hits on the Hot 100. Now, that sum climbs to 137 placements in the competitive region. She still trails only Drake, who has thus far accumulated 199 top 40 wins. So far, no other artist has reached 100 top 40 hits.
With more music on the way and two more albums to re-record, it’s only a matter of time before Swift ups that sum again. Perhaps next year, she may hit 150 top 40 smashes, and from there, it’s impossible to tell how much bigger that figure can become.
Here is a list of where all of Taylor Swift’s songs rank on the Hot 100 this week.
