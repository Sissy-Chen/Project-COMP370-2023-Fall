Swifties around the world have reason to celebrate, as their favorite singer has revealed that she is taking her upcoming concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, global. Initially, the superstar was only focused on the North American market, but now the movie is about to become an international affair.
Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is set to hit movie theaters in 100 countries. The film will be available to watch for fans almost everywhere on October 13, the original release date in North America. A select number of nations, such as Brazil, India, South Korea and others, will have to wait until November 3.
Tickets for international screenings outside North America are either already on sale or should be available to purchase soon via a dedicated website.
Swift shared the good news on Instagram, stating, "The tour isn't the only thing we're taking worldwide. Been so excited to tell you all that 'The Eras Tour' concert film is now officially coming to theaters WORLDWIDE on Oct 13!"
Just as is the case in North America, distribution of Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour will be handled by AMC Theatres and Variance Releasing.
Now that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour will be in theaters globally at once, chances are its opening weekend box office draw will expand, perhaps significantly. Film industry projections have already placed its first-weekend sum at upwards of $100 million. That number would make the title the top-grossing concert film of all time.
