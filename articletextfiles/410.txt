The fact that the international pop sensation chose the game to show her support for Kelce raised many eyebrows and helped break several records. The demand for Kelce’s jersey skyrocketed and the number of his Instagram followers also swelled. While it may not be clear if the two are dating (or are just friends), the development seemed to have irked Benberry, who dated the NFL star in 2016.

Their romance began when she was a contestant on the reality show, Catching Kelce and the relationship lasted for around eight months. She went on to describe Kelce as a “narcissist and a cheater” in another interview.
She also alleged that some Swifties — the singer’s fans — had been giving her death threats after she chose to speak out about the budding relationship.

She talked about what being in a relationship with Kelce was like and insisted that she harbored no hard feelings.
The reactions to her comments were noteworthy. “They interviewing this woman after them being done for 7 years?” a fan wrote. “That’s right, she’s so jealous she isn’t on his arm. That’s all this is, and a money grab. She’s probably broke,” one fan added. Benberry admitted that she faced backlash after she had implied that Kelce might cheat on Swift.

Benberry also added that she thought she was going to marry Kelce. She said that she had a key to his penthouse. She pointed an accusatory finger at Kelce, “Like the saying goes, once a cheater, always a cheater.” She said she had brought the cheating allegations to light some five years ago. “Now five years later, you’re laughing, and I feel like you’re mocking me,” she was quoted as saying.
