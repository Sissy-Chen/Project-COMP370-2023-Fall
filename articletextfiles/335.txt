Everybody wants to live within Taylor Swift’s lavender haze.   No one more so than Elon Musk. 
The very-online billionaire on Wednesday made a plea to the “I Knew You Were Trouble” artist on X — formerly known as Twitter —  after Swift promoted  the upcoming re-release of her 2014 album “1989.” 
Soon after Swift’s announcement, Musk replied to the singer’s X post with the news by writing, “I recommend posting some music or concert videos directly on the X platform.”

Swift did not publicly respond in any way to Musk’s suggestion.
In her original post, Swift wrote: “It’s a new soundtrack. Here are the back covers and vault track titles for ‘1989’ (my version) I can’t wait for this one to be out, seriously. Thank you for playing along, sleuthing, puzzling and making these reveals so much chaotic fun (which is the best kind of fun, after all).”
The “Bad Blood” musician also dropped the names of all her upcoming vault tracks after teasing fans with a video of a blue vault spitting out letters on her Instagram on Tuesday.

‘1989 (Taylor’s Version)’ will be the fourth rerecording Taylor Swift releases in her quest to reclaim the rights to her past albums.

“You can tell me when the *search* is over… if the high was worth the pain😎,” she captioned the video, making a reference to one of the  “1989”  hits “Blank Space.” 
That promo sent Swifties into a frenzy Tuesday night. As part of a partnership with Google, Swift revealed the name of four of the five vault tracks, after 33 — notably Swift is 33  — million fans solved Swift-related puzzles on the search engine. 
The name of the vault tracks are: “Is It Over Now?,” “Now That We Don’t Talk,” “Say Don’t Go,” “Suburban Legends” and “Slut!” — which was the surprise track that wasn’t announced in the Google promotion.

It’s hard to choose a handful of highlights from Taylor Swift’s three-hour-plus extravaganza, but these dozen moments showed her at the very top of her game.

The Grammy winner’s new spin on  “1989”  will be the fourth record to get  “Taylor’s Version” treatment — the latest in her quest to reclaim the rights to her first six albums. 
The award-winning  record, whose rerecording is due in October, was billed as Swift’s first “official pop album” and included the inescapable hits “Shake It Off,” “Style” “Blank Space,” “Wildest Dreams” and the gossip-laden “Bad Blood.” It also marked a seismic shift from her status as a crossover-country darling to a bona fide pop star.
