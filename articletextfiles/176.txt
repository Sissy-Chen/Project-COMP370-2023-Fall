Taylor Swift continues to dominate the pop radio airwaves in America with her latest single, "Cruel Summer." The tune still holds the No. 1 position on the Pop Airplay chart, Billboard's ranking of the most-played tracks at pop radio in the United States. This latest frame marks Swift's seventh consecutive week atop the chart and solidifies her status as one of the most successful acts in the chart's history.
With "Cruel Summer" now enjoying its seventh week at No. 1 on the Pop Airplay chart, Swift has accumulated a total of 39 weeks in the top spot throughout her career when considering all of her No. 1 hits on the tally. This impressive feat ties her with pop band Maroon 5, and together, they jointly claim the third-most weeks spent in charge of the ranking.
When looking at all artists who have topped the Pop Airplay chart, Katy Perry leads the pack with an impressive 47 weeks at No. 1. She is closely followed by Mariah Carey, who has so far managed 45 weeks in the top position.
Before this week, Swift was tied with Justin Bieber, with each chart-topper boasting 38 turns in first place. However, as “Cruel Summer” continues to rule the ranking, Swift has now surpassed Bieber in this regard, at least for the time being.
Swift currently holds the record for the most No. 1 hits among all artists on the Pop Airplay chart, with a total of twelve chart-toppers. With her continued radio success, it appears that Swift is poised to extend her lead, and she may soon break the tie with Maroon 5, further solidifying her position as a pop radio powerhouse.
