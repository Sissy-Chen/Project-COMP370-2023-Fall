This week, the Hot 100’s top spot belongs to newcomer Oliver Anthony, who has skyrocketed to the peak with his breakout hit "Rich Men North of Richmond." In a matter of weeks, Anthony's song has transformed him from an unknown artist into a chart-topping sensation. The tune has earned a second stay atop the Hot 100, but it doesn’t seem like a third is in the cards for the tune.
But when looking ahead to next week, the landscape could shift dramatically, as several strong contenders vie for the coveted No. 1 position.
Twitter accounts known for predicting Billboard chart standings with remarkable precision have highlighted a handful of tracks that are making a serious bid for the No. 1 spot on the Hot 100 next week. Early predictions suggest that these contenders are all closely matched, and the final rankings could be swayed by various factors in the days ahead.
Zach Bryan, another relatively new artist, seems poised to collect only a No. 1 album but also a No. 1 song on the Hot 100. The singer-songwriter has experienced an incredible surge in popularity over the past year, and his new music could propel him to an unexpected victory. His collaboration with Kacey Musgraves on the single "I Remember Everything" is garnering substantial attention from his just-released self-titled album, and he track's strong performance might lead to a debut champion for both artists.
Country musician Luke Combs is also vying for his first No. 1 on the Hot 100, albeit not with a new release. His rendition of Tracy Chapman's "Fast Car" has lingered at No. 2 on the chart, repeatedly falling just short of the top spot. Combs is pulling out all the stops to drive the song to its peak, but so far, it has faced stiff competition from other viral hits.
Taylor Swift's current single, "Cruel Summer," shouldn't be dismissed, even as its momentum wanes. The pop track, taken from her 2019 album Lover, rapidly climbed into the Hot 100's top 10 after its official release. Fans are hoping for another chart-topping success for Swift, and if she can rekindle interest, increase streaming and sales, there's a possibility that the song could conquer the tally.
Anticipation is building around Doja Cat's forthcoming album Scarlet, which she states is now done. The latest single from the album, "Paint The Town Red," has garnered tremendous attention in a short span of time. While it was released not long ago, it's swiftly become a massive hit for the rapper and singer.
This week, the single bolts into the Hot 100’s top 10, reaching a new high of No. 5 in only its third week on the ranking. With its rapidly growing popularity and ascent up the charts, it stands a good chance of clinching the No. 1 spot in the near future. While Cat has reached No. 1 before, it's worth noting that this potential victory would be on her own merit.
Presently, all five of these singles are bona fide contenders for the No. 1 position on the Hot 100. While one track may currently lead the race, various factors could shift the balance in the upcoming days, and it’s really anybody's race at the moment. A fierce competition is unfolding as these stars strive to outshine each other and ascend the throne atop the most significant songs chart in the U.S.
