The first day out on the Italian greens turned out to be a nightmare for the US Ryder Cup team. Not only did the Europeans script their dominance in the first half of the game with 4-0, but they also proved their potential in the second half of the game with a final score of 6.5-1.5. However, despite failing to shush the European audience with their skills, US Captain Zach Johnson seems to have his boys‚Äô back.

Seemingly undaunted, the captain had words of appreciation to shower on his teammates. As the players prepare to redeem themselves and try to overpower the European squad, Zach Johnson‚Äôs words might come in handy. However, until now, this positive reinforcement hasn‚Äôt seemed to have the same effect on the fans. They can‚Äôt help but be baffled by the 47-year-old‚Äôs remarks.

With zero matchup wins in their pocket until now, the American side looks completely run over by the home team. Where the European side had all its senior players displaying exceptional skills on the tricky course, the same could hardly be said about the US stars.
In the morning foursomes, from World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler to the senior members of the side like Rickie Fowler and Jordan Spieth, no one could display their control of the game. None of the four pairings could even compete with their assigned opponents until the last 18th hole. If the foursomes were an indication, the afternoon four-ball worsened the scenario for the American men.

Seemingly, the golfer was referring to the slight comeback his team has made on the challenging greens. And while the leader‚Äôs backing appears to be great, the fans online seem hardly impressed by the American Ryder Cup side‚Äôs efforts. Putting forth their honest opinion, the golf lovers shared a common reaction of astonishment at Johnson‚Äôs unexpected support.

Other fans mentioned how the team should have been inclined more toward experienced players like Dustin Johnson and Bryson DeChambeau, despite their connection to the controversial LIV Golf.

The golfer‚Äôs lack of winning spirit dissatisfied one viewer. Targeting Johnson‚Äôs selection, the fan called out the captain for being responsible for the current situation of the US team.
