Taylor Swift recently announced her upcoming re-recording, 1989 (Taylor’s Version), much to the delight of her massive fan base. The singer revealed the album cover and release date, October 27, during a momentous performance during her ongoing The Eras Tour. Since this much-anticipated revelation, fans across the country have flocked to revisit the original 1989, propelling its iconic songs to dominate Spotify's charts.
14 tracks from the original 1989 have swiftly surged onto Spotify's list of the most-streamed songs in the U.S. This remarkable presence marks a substantial increase from the prior day, when legions of Swifties eagerly anticipated the thrilling announcement had already started streaming the familiar cuts from the album.
Nearly every gem from the 1989 era makes its presence felt on the chart, with numerous tracks either making their debut or reaching previously unknown heights. The numbers reported below are as of Friday, August 11.
Six 1989 tracks soar to new peaks following the announcement. Spearheading this resurgence is “Style” which rises 20 spots to settle at a new peak of No. 8. "Blank Space" comes next and isn’t far behind, surging an impressive 25 places to settle at No. 12, narrowly missing the coveted top 10 nearly a decade after its initial release.
Other chart-climbing hits include "Shake It Off," which ascends a staggering 117 positions to land at No. 34. "Out of the Woods" ventures to a noteworthy new peak of No. 41, while "Bad Blood" shoots to No. 57. "Wildest Dreams" reappears at No. 63, and the anthem "Welcome to New York" achieves its best chart position yet at No. 82.
Immediately after announcing 1989 (Taylor’s Version), Swift performed the song "New Romantics," a bonus track on the original 1989. That attention has helped the tune score an impressive debut on the Spotify U.S. chart, starting at No. 31. This win represents the highest-ranking new entry from the superstar, but it is far from the only one.
An array of fellow 1989-era melodies, including "All You Had to Do Was Stay," "I Wish You Would," "Clean," "How You Get the Girl," "I Know Places," "Wonderland" and "You Are in Love," all claim their rightful spots on the chart for the first time. These tracks, spurred by the excitement of the 1989 (Taylor’s Version) announcement, have enjoyed a meteoric resurgence in popularity, hitting the tally for the first time, as their heyday was largely before the ranking was popular.
The sheer magnitude of the news and the excitement felt by Swift’s fanbase have also breathed new life into a familiar tune. The re-released version of "Wildest Dreams," aptly renamed "Wildest Dreams (Taylor’s Version)," had previously graced this prestigious ranking, and its return at No. 151 reflects the insatiable energy surrounding Swift's announcement.
Beyond the dozen-plus streaming sensations from 1989, Swift's presence is felt all across Spotify's 200-spot chart. In fact, that album doesn’t even make up half of the tunes she has on the tally.
"Cruel Summer" holds at its No. 2 position, proving itself to still be a streaming giant. A collection of beloved hits spanning multiple albums—including Lover, Reputation, Fearless (Taylor’s Version), and the recent Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)—all find space as well, ranking as among the most-streamed in America.
