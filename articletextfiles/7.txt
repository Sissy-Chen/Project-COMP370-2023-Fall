Taylor Swift‘s Eras Tour has been a mainstay in pop culture over the last year. Those who didn’t catch Swift along her lauded trek now have a chance to witness all the action when the movie version of the tour premieres on October 13. While we eagerly wait for the movie, check out five things we can expect from the release below.

Since we know which shows were filmed for use in the movie, we have a short list of which surprise songs could appear on the big screen. The first three of six shows in Los Angeles were captured for the concert film. Among the options from those shows are “I Can See You,” “Maroon,” “Our Song,” “You Are in Love,” “Death by a Thousand Cuts,” and “You’re on Your Own, Kid.” It’s a stacked list. Any way you cut it, the Swifties will be pleased. 
HAIM was one of the featured opening acts for Swift’s Los Angeles shows. Each night of her six-night stand, the trio joined Swift for a rendition of their evermore collaboration, “no body, no crime.” If you had FOMO over missing Swift and HAIM ham it up on stage together, fret not. One of their performances will likely be featured in the movie. 
While much of the Eras Tour is focused on Swift’s upbeat anthems, there are a few emotional moments throughout. From “champagne problems” to “marjorie,” there is a good chance some tears could be shed. Swift herself has gotten emotional over the course of the tour performing those songs. We can only imagine how affecting they will be in high def. 
Just a few days after the release of the movie, Swift will share 1989 (Taylor’s Version). The hype for her latest re-recording project will likely only grow after watching Swift perform cuts from the blockbuster record. Across the setlist, Swift plays “Blank Space,” “Style,” “Shake It Off,” “Bad Blood,” and “Wildest Dreams.” The anthems are undisputed bangers and are guaranteed to get fans excited for the updated versions. 
The Eras Tour movie doesn’t abide by typical movie-going standards. There will be no silencing your phone or sitting quietly so as to not disturb your fellow audience members. Swift hopes the movie will be an extension of the actual tour. That means the seats will be packed with passionate fans, screaming at the top of their lungs in over-the-top outfits. If you aren’t Swift’s biggest fan, perhaps avoid your local theater for a few days, it will officially become Swiftie territory as of October 13.
